            <p>On October 4–5, 2024, I participated in one of the Islamic Education (PAI) competitions, the Islamic Religious Education Quiz Competition (LCC PAI) for Balikpapan City. This competition was held at SMPN 14 Balikpapan City.</p>

            <p>After going through a fairly difficult selection process, Faza, Dafiya, and I were chosen to represent the <strong>SMP Al Imam Islamic School Balikpapan (AISBA)</strong>. After being selected, we were mentored by Ustadzah Ratna. We were given an outline of the material we had to study—a very diverse range: from Islamic history, Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), verses from the Quran, basically everything about Islam!</p>

            <p>Day after day passed until the big day arrived. On Friday, October 4, 2024, all the PAI (Islamic Education) participants gathered on the SMPN 14 field for the opening ceremony. At that moment, I started to feel very nervous—my heart was beating fast. From the participant list, I knew there were 55 teams from 55 junior high schools across Balikpapan City. I was afraid my team wouldn't make it to the semifinals.</p>

            <p>The preliminary session began in a crowded hall. We were asked to fill in our names and schools via a QR code link. There were about 100 multiple-choice questions in total. Faza, Dafiya, and I worked carefully. If we found any questions difficult, we marked them. Once we were finished and confident, we submitted our answers.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>"When time was up, the judges displayed the ranking screen. Unfortunately, the screen wasn't visible from behind. When the judges started reading out the teams that had qualified, we were so nervous. It turned out, our team qualified in 5th place! Alhamdulillah</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saturday, October 5, 2024, the semifinals began at 8 a.m. This round was divided into three sessions. Faza drew "3B," meaning we would be competing in session 3. I was quite relieved to see how the other participants responded. I saw that the participants in sessions 1 and 2 were excellent; they were fast and detailed.</p>

            <p>It was our turn. I was appointed spokesperson and sat in the middle. I was initially pessimistic because we were behind the SMPN 18 team in points. But slowly but surely, we caught up and finally won in session 3! We advanced to the final round! We immediately exited the hall, met Ustadzah Ratna, and cried tears of joy while hugging each other.</p>

            <p>In the final, we faced two strong teams from SMPIT Al Auliya and SMP Islamic Global School. We were able to answer the round-robin questions well, but the scramble round was a tough challenge. We had to be quick, and some questions, like the eclipse prayer and the funeral prayer, were quite difficult because they were rare for us. But we kept trying.</p>

            <p>By the final two questions, our team had 1,075 points. Ultimately, our final score secured us <strong>3rd place</strong>. Two months later, the much-awaited recognition finally arrived. In addition to trophies and certificates, we also received cash prizes as a reward for our hard work. It felt great to be able to reap the rewards of our hard work to add to our savings.</p>
